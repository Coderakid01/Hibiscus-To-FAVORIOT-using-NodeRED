  >In this tutorial we will make a project Wireless Sensor Network by using 1 Unit of Hibiscus Sense that will send the data to 1 Unit of ESP32 (Optionally you can also use LCD for the display).

  <h3>Before you start, Please make sure that you have found the Receiver MAC Address of the RECEIVER.<h3>
  <h4>To communicate via ESP-NOW, you need to know the MAC Address of the RECEIVER. That’s how you know to which device you’ll send the information to. There's a folder named WSN_Get_MAC_Address_For_Receiver the Source code inside there is use to find the MAC Address of the RECEIVER. After you have upload the code please write the MAC Address acquired at any place for the next use, later you replace it with Receiver Code for the RECEIVER.</h4>
